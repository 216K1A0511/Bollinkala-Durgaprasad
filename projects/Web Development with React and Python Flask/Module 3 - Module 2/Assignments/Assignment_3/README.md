# Test Taker Interface

## Overview
This project is a responsive and accessible test taker interface designed for the IELTS Speaking Test registration platform. The interface allows users to input their details before starting the test.

## Objective
Create a responsive HTML webpage for test takers using semantic HTML elements. The webpage should include a form to collect user details, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness.

## Scenario
As part of the IELTS Speaking Test platform, a webpage is required for test takers to input their details before starting the test. This interface should be user-friendly and accessible across different devices.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML Structure**: Uses `<header>`, `<section>`, `<form>`, and `<footer>` for improved readability and SEO.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop) using CSS media queries.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Labels, placeholders, and ARIA attributes ensure better usability for screen readers.
- **Styled Form**: The form is visually appealing with proper padding, spacing, and hover effects.

## Requirements
### 1. Structure the HTML Page
- Use semantic elements (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<form>`) for better readability and SEO.

### 2. Design the Form
- Include the following fields:
  - **Name** (text input, required)
  - **Email** (email input, required)
  - **Test Section** (dropdown with options: Speaking, Listening, Writing)
- Add a submit button.

### 3. Ensure Responsiveness
- Use a responsive layout to make the page compatible with mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

### 4. Add Accessibility Features
- Use `aria-labels`, placeholders, and field labels for accessibility.

### 5. Style the Page
- Use basic CSS for styling:
  - Center the form on the page.
  - Add padding and spacing for a clean layout.
  - Use hover effects on the submit button.
