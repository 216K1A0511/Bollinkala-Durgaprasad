# IELTS Speaking Test Platform - React & Flask Integration

## Overview
This project integrates the React frontend with the Flask backend to dynamically fetch and display IELTS Speaking Test questions. The React application communicates with the Flask API endpoint `/api/speaking-tests` to retrieve test questions and render them dynamically.

## Features
- Fetch test questions from the Flask backend using Axios or Fetch API.
- Display test questions dynamically in the frontend.
- Manage API data using React state (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- Implement error handling for API failures with user-friendly feedback.
- Ensure a visually appealing UI that aligns with the platformâ€™s design.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Flask API)
1. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or later).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors flask-sqlalchemy
   ```
3. Run the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:5000/api/speaking-tests`.

### Frontend (React)
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Navigate to the React project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. The frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## API Integration
The frontend fetches test questions from the backend using the following API request:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/speaking-tests")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => setQuestions(data))
        .catch(error => console.error("Error fetching data:", error));
}, []);
```

## Error Handling
- If the API request fails, an error message is displayed to the user.
- Retry options can be implemented for better user experience.

## Deliverables
- Updated React components with API integration.
- Dynamic question rendering.
- Evidence of successful integration (screenshots or screen recordings).

## Submission
1. Submit the updated React files.
2. Include a description of the setup process and testing evidence.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **API Integration (40%)**: Correct implementation of backend communication.
- **Dynamic Rendering (30%)**: Questions should be fetched and displayed dynamically.
- **Error Handling (20%)**: Proper error messages and graceful fallbacks.
- **Submission Completeness (10%)**: All required files and evidence provided.

## Notes
Ensure clean and modular code for better readability and scalability. Follow best practices for API integration and error handling.
