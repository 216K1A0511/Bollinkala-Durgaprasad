# Random Password Manager

A CLI-based, secure password manager for storing and retrieving credentials using file handling and encrypted storage.

## Features

- **Secure encryption:** Uses a master password to encrypt credentials with PBKDF2 and Fernet.[1]
- **Random password generator:** Creates strong, unpredictable passwords for each new credential.[1]
- **Simple CLI menu:** Add and retrieve entries with an easy-to-use interface.[3][1]
- **File-based vault:** Credentials are securely stored in `vault.json`.[1]
- **Salt Storage:** Cryptographic salt stored separately for extra security.[1]

## How It Works

- When adding a new entry, the tool generates a strong random password, encrypts it, and saves to the vault file.
- Retrieval requires the master password and website name; the tool decrypts and displays stored data.
- Salt is stored in `.salt` to ensure unique key derivation per vault.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/random-password-manager.git
   cd random-password-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install cryptography
   ```

3. Run the tool:
   ```
   python password_manager.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Add a new entry:**  
  Select option 1 in the menu, enter your master password, website, and username/email. A strong password is generated, encrypted, and stored.

- **Retrieve an entry:**  
  Select option 2, enter your master password and website name to view credentials.

- **Exit:**  
  Select option 3 to quit.

## Security Notes

- Uses strong PBKDF2 key derivation and Fernet symmetric encryption.
- Master password should be long and unique â€“ do not lose it!
- Vault file (`vault.json`) and salt (`.salt`) should be kept secret.
- Project is for educational/demo use; review real-world security best practices before personal deployment.

## Example

```
Random Password Manager
1. Add new entry
2. Retrieve entry
3. Exit
```

## Possible Extensions

- Add database support for multi-device sync.
- Integrate a GUI (Tkinter or PyQt).
- Auto-fill passwords in browsers.
- Password strength checker.
- User authentication and two-factor support.
